    overview:
      "The C++ Training program provides a complete understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and their practical applications. Designed as an advanced extension of C, this course teaches how to build robust, optimized, and scalable software using C++. Students will learn the fundamentals of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exception handling, and the Standard Template Library (STL). By the end of the course, learners will be able to design efficient, real-world applications using C++.",
